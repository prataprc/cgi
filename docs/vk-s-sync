A memory dependency is an execution dependency which includes availability and visibility operations such that:
* The first set of operations happens-before the availability operation.
* The availability operation happens-before the visibility operation.
* The visibility operation happens-before the second set of operations.

Image subresources can be transitioned from one layout to another as part of a memory dependency
