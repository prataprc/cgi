* natural numbers - whole numbers - rational numbers - irrational numbers.
* complex numbers.

* algebraic expressions - add, sub, mult, div and exp - exp of rational numbers.
* polynomial - (linear, 1) - (quadratic, 2) - (cubic, 3), (quartic, 4), (quintic, 5).
* polynomial - made of terms, combined using add-op and sub-op - uniterm, biterm, triterm.
* univariate - expression with one variable; bivariate, trivariate.
* binomial-theorem, binomial-form, pascal-triangle.
* parametric-functions

* linear-interpolation, bi-linear, tri-linear, bezier-surfaces.

* permutation, order matter => nPr => n! / (n-r)!
* combination, order does not matter => nPr => n! / (r! * (n-r)!)
